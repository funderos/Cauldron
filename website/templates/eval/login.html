Welcome to the Cauldron project! Thank you for your interest in participating in this survey, it will take about 20-30 minutes.
</p><p>
The analytic tools on this website help to view, visualize, and analyze player and match data from the video game League of Legends (LOL). LOL is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game where two teams, each consisting of 5 players, compete against each other in strategic matches.
</p><p>
Collected information will be used for evaluation statistics which will be then published anonymously in a) the master thesis "A visualization approach for analyzing social networks and triangulating them with psychological measures" by Benjamin Funder and b) scientific publications.
</p><p>
I appreciate your help in evaluating the analysis tools on this website for my master thesis! Feel free to contact me via e-mail for additional information: funderb91@univie.ac.at
